# Compiler-for-String-Diagrams

Abstract: We introduce a tool that allows users to create and edit string diagrams of symmetric monoidal categories, and translate them to their textual representation or vice versa. Before this project, there has been no tool that supports drawing a string diagram and then translating it to a textual representation and vice versa, as there is a challenge of how a string diagram can be represented with multiple different textual representations. Some of the additional features the tool provides includes a GUI and a way to export translated string diagrams. Development was carried out on an incremental model, starting from core features and building up more features from the previous stage.
