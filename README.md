# Compiler-for-String-Diagrams

Abstract: We introduce a tool that allows users to create and edit string diagrams of symmetric monoidalcategories, and translate them to their textual representation or vice versa.  Before this project,there has been no tool that supports drawing a string diagram and then translating it to a textualrepresentation and vice versa, as there is a challenge of how a string diagram can be representedwith multiple different textual representations.  Some of the additional features the tool providesincludes a GUI and a way to export translated string diagrams.  Development was carried out onan incremental model, starting from core features and building up more features from the previous stage.
